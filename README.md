# Analysis of the World's Oldest Businesses

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

![Staffelter Hof Winery]()

Staffelter Hof Winery is Germany's oldest business, established in 862 under the Carolingian dynasty. It has continued to serve customers through dramatic changes in Europe, such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and both world wars. This raises the question: **What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?**

To help answer this question, this project analyzes a dataset from BusinessFinancing.co.uk, which researched the oldest company still in business in almost every country.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The primary goal is to analyze data from multiple CSV files to better understand the world's oldest businesses. This involves using SQL to join and manipulate the data to uncover insights into business longevity.
